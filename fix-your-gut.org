* Mechanisms of the human digestive system
  - ideal digestive system eliminates toxins, governs the immune system, absorbs
    nutrients, provides peak mental health
** The mouth and esophagus
   - chewing is critical for good digestion
   - esophagus and les (lower esophageal sphincter)
** Stomach
   - only digestive organ that mechanically, chemically, and enzymatically
     digests food
*** Mechanically
    - muscles that churn food contents and mix with acid and pepsin
    - lower stomach sphincter propels food into duodenum or pushes back into
      stomach for more digesting
*** Chemically
    - hydrochloric acid
      - acid does not digest food, just maintains proper pH balance, allowing
        gastrin to be able to break down food
      - also eliminates any excess bactera that were ingested
      - can help denature proteins but pepsin does majority
    - stomach produces mucus which coats and protects the stomach wall so will
      not be harmed by gastric acid
*** Enzymatically/Hormonal
    - once stomach distends, gastrin released
      - can also be released by stimulation of vagus nerve, undigested proteins
        in stomach, and elevated levels of calcium in blood
      - stimulates stomach cells to release HCL, activates stomach cell growth,
        initiates the secretion of pepsinogen, which becomes protein enzyme
        pepsin, induces pancreatic secretions, gallbladder emptying, and causes
        LES to tighten and begin digestion
      - excess of stomach acid inhibits gastrin production
    - pepsin is primary enzyme used by stomach to digest protein
      - breaks protein into amino acids body can absorb and then becomes
        inactivated, by turning back into pepsinogen when it is mixed with
        bicarbonate released from pancreas in small intestine. This protects
        rest of intestinal system from pepsin and stomach acid
    - lipase breaks down fats
    - mucin coats lining of stomach
** On gastrin
   - hormone that controls digestion
   - gastrin release occurs because:
     - stomach body expands from consumption
     - vagus nerve stimulation
     - partially digested protein or amino acid supplements in stomach
     - hypercalcemia
     - ingestion of coffee and alcohol
     - h pylori colonization of the antrum
     - using medications including andrenergic stimulating drugs, cholinergic
       agents, and H2 antagonists / PPI's
     - hormone bombesin, ephinephrine, and gastrin releasing peptide
     - gastrin producing tumors
     - zollinger-ellison syndrome
   - signals stomach to secrete gastric acid and release histamine
   - does a lot to improve digestion
     - causes chief cells in stomach to produce pepsinogen, which becomes pepsin
     - decreases upper stomach contractoins and motility to help improve
       digestion by increasing stomach relaxation to allow ingestion of more
       food and further digestion by stomach acid and pepsin
     - opens pyloric sphincter and increases rate of gastric emptying
     - increases small intestine MMC function and helps relax ileocecal valve
     - induces pancreatic enzyme secretion
     - stimulates bile release from gallbladder
     - helps regulate production of gastric epithelial cells, tissue repair, and
       blood vessel growth in stomach
   - gastrin production limited when stomach pH is below three, fasting,
     pancreas releases somatostatin, inhibitory peptide, secretin, glucagon, and calcitonin
   - when most food out of stomach, enterogastric reflex occurs to reduce
     gastric motility, gastrin release, and gastric acid production
   - to produce appropriate gastrin levels, need to balance calcium levels,
     reduce upper gut overgrowth like h pylori, and maintain proper stomach ph
   - can achieve proper stomach ph by ingesting betaine HCL, acidic foods, or
     digestive bitters towards end of meal if you can tolerate them to help
     accurately control gastrin production and aid digestion
** Intrinsic factor
   - intrinsic factor helps absorb vitamin B12 further along in intestines
   - production of intrinsic factor in stomach can be hindered by having low
     stomach acid or by taking medications that lower stomach acid
   - supplementation of B12 might be needed
** Liver, gallbladder, and pancreas
   - further regulate the enzymatic and chemical side of digestion
   - liver produces bile and releases to small intestine or gallbladder where it
     is stored till needed
   - bile breaks down fats so digestive enzymes can fully break down food
   - pancreas produces acinar cells, responsible for releasing most of digestive
     enzymes into intestines
     - also makes ductal cells which release sodium bicarbonate into small
       intestine to neutralize stomach acid released from stomach into duodenum
** Small intestine
   - three parts, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum
   - mostly enzymatic digestion
   - cilia and muscle contractions move chyme through intestines (peristalsis)
*** Major nutrients that are digested in the small intestine
    - proteins break into peptides an amino acids
    - pepsin begins process in stomach, small intestine breaks down further
    - lipids degrade into fatty acids and glycerol. Pancreatic lipase breaks
      down triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides (accomplishes
      with help of bile acid salts which emulsify triglycerides until lipase can
      break down further to enter villi for absorption
    - pancreatic amylase breaks down carbohydrates into oligosaccharides
    - some simple carbohydrates can be converted quickly into glucose and be absorbed
    - other carbohydrates pass undigested into large intestine where they
      ferment before being broken down by bacteria
    - cellulose cannot be broken down by humans and passes through intestines
*** Nutrients that are absorbed in small intestine
    - iron in duodenum
    - water, fat, and fructose
    - vitamin B12 and bile salts in ileum
    - sodium bicarbonate
**** duodenum
     - primarily responsible for breakdown of food in small intestine
     - hormones secretin and cholecystokinin cause liver or gallbladder to
       release bile, and pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive enzymes
     - secretin helps regulate ph in duodenum by inactivating gastric acid secretion
**** jejunum
     - absorption of small nutrient particles by enterocytes
     - once absorbed, nutrients pass from enterocytes into enterohepatic
       circulation and enter liver via the hepatic portal vein where blood is filtered
     - jejunum end of chemical digestion and most byproducts of chemical
       digestion (bile, bicarbonate) are absorbed back into body in ileum
**** ileum
     - absorbs nutrients and digestive byproducts
     - absorbs B12, as well as bile, fatty acids, and glycerol
     - release protease to break down remaining proteins
     - remaining chyme deposits into large intestine through ileocecal valve to
       turn into feces
** Large intestine
   - peristalsis slows to allow probiotic bacteria to ferment chyme
   - converts chyme into feces to be eliminated from body (about sixteen hours)
   - removes excess water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from chyme
     before sending indigestible matter to rectum
   - houses over seven hundred species of bacteria that perform a variety of
     functions for human body
   - colon absorbs vitamins produced by colonic bacterial metabolism from
     fermenting food (vitamin K, B12, thiamine, riboflavin, and biotin)
   - undigested fiber other than cellulose metabolized into short-chain fatty
     acids and absorbed into bloodstream
   - flatulence, caused by bacterial fermentation, formed and expelled through
     large intestine during digestion
   - probiotic gut flora essential in developing large intestine epithelial
     cells, lymphatic cells, cross-reactive antibodies (that eliminate foreign
     bacteria), and help maintain natural mucus barrier
   - feces travel down large intestine by peristalsis, pass through colon, and
     expelled through anal sphincter
** Immune system and Gut/ GALT
   - intestinal system one of most important components of immune system
   - intestines made up of both probiotics and gut-associated lymphoid tissue
     that helps regulate a significant part of human immune system
   - gut contains largest mass of lymphoid tissue in body
   - lymphoid tissue help destroy pathogens
   - 50 to 80 percent of immune system stored in GALT
   - GALT lies behind mucosal lining of gut and only one cell wall thick
   - probiotic bacteria live in symbiosis with GALT and partially compose entire
     immune system
   - probiotics both yeast and bacteria that help maintain proper
     gastrointestinal function, break down lactose, manufacture and absorb
     vitamin K, B12, thiamine, riboflavin, biotin, destroy opportunistic
     bacteria, and ferment carbohydrates for digestion
** The gut: the second brain
   - if gastrointestinal system if having problems functioning normally, can
     create depression and increase anxiety levels
   - gut has nervous system, enteric nervous system
   - ENS influences mental health function because of large network of neurons,
     nerves, and neurotransmitters
   - ens communicates with cns using vagus nerve and prevertebral ganglia
   - neurons in ens can control peristalsis and what digestive enzymes are released
   - uses more than thirty neurotransmitters identical to ones in CNS
   - serotonin used in large amounts in gut for muscle contractions needed in
     peristalsis of food
   - ninety percent of anyone's serotonin and fifty percent of dopamine found in gut
   - bacteria can influence what hormones and neurotransmitters are used in gut
   - if you have leaky gut, may affect brain by excessive amounts of
     neurotransmitters, pathogens, and toxins being able to cross blood-brain barrier
** What is melatonin?
   - melatonin is neurotransmitter that was originally believed to be produced
     only be pineal bland in brain
   - very important to overall function of human body acting as antioxidant,
     regulating circadian rhythm (internal clock), reduces blood pressure, and
     leptin levels (hormone that inhibits hunger) during sleep
   - been discovered in large quantities in other organs as well
   - also synthesized by gut flora at rates 400 times greater than pineal gland
   - large amounts in vermiform appendix, which appears to be safe house for
     probiotic flora during gastrointestinal infection
   - bacteria have circadian rhythm, so they produce melatonin in dark and
     possibly as signaling hormone
** Melatonin and the gut
   - not much is known but here are some theories
     - protects gastric mucosa from free radicals, medications, and gastrotoxic agents
     - reduces production of hcl and pepsin production when sleeping. Reduces
       the chance of esophageal, peptic, and duodenal ulcers
     - reduction of reflux while sleeping and awake
     - improves les and ues pressure regulation
     - reduces risk of developing barrett's esophagus by increasing blood flow
       to esophagus and reducing inflammation
     - reduction of bowel spasms and improving mmc function in people with sibo-d
     - reinforces proper mmc function during sleep by regulating the
       interstitial cells of Cajal. Majority of MMC functions occurs while we
       sleep; it is longest period of fasting for body
** Sleep hygiene and melatonin
   - we are supersaturated with blue light during night
   - blue light reduces melatonin production and increases serotonin which keeps
     us awake
   - light from cell phone screens and led monitors
   - light pollution through blinds interferes
   - how to ensure proper melotonin production?
   - first make gut flora happy by avoiding sugar and polyols and focus on
     diverse seasonal diet
   - eat prebiotic fiber (limit supplemental prebiotics, except for GOS
     occasionally) and fermented foods
   - flora in gut produce lot of melatonin so want to make them strong
   - limit blue light at night
     - wear blue light blocking glasses
     - install programs like f.lux on computer
     - do not fall asleep with television or any electronic device on
     - blackout curtains
   - improve sleep hygiene
     - do not sleep in frigid or sweltering bedroom
     - optimal temperature 60-70
     - do not go to sleep on full stomach
     - sleep on left side or back for greatest oxygen saturation. Sleeping on
       left side puts more pressure on LES keeping it closed
     - take in small amount of carbohydrates before bed. One or two teaspoons or
       raw honey or twenty grams of trehalose before bed mixed with spring water
       can help improve sleep by stabilizing blood glucose
     - turn off non-native EMF (wifi, phone etc)
** What is CCK and what does it do?
   - CCK stands for cholecystokinin and it is synthesized in mucosal epithelium
     of small intestine and secreted into duodenum. Release of CCK is stimulated
     by peptide released by pancreatic acinar cells and CCK releasing protein
     secreted by enterocytes in mucosa. Greatest stimulator is presence of
     fatty/amino acids in chyme when it enters duodenum
*** The hormone does a lot including
    - stimulating release of bile from gallbladder and digestive enzymes from pancreas
    - increases bile production by liver
    - increases sodium bicarbonate production by pancreas to neutralize stomach acid
    - slows down gastric emptying and decreases stomach acid secretion
    - induces satiety
    - increases opioid tolerance
    - plays a role in increasing sensitivity to pain
    - reduces inflammatory markers including TNF and Il-6
    - increases aldosterone (homrone that increases retention of sodium and
      increases blood pressure) and cortisol
    - helps to regulate MMC function in conjunction with the hypothalamus
    - overproduction can lead to postprandial fatigue and sleepiness (the ITIS!)
    - as chyme, digestive enzymes, and bile pass further into small intestine,
      CCK release diminishes
*** So what does all this have to do with anxiety?
    - single CCK peptide known as CCK-4 to blame
    - when fat digestion issues, upper gut infections, SIBO, or leaky gut, CCK
      peptides are more likely to cross the BBB (specifically CCK-4)
    - it overstimulates the vagus nerve and induces panic
    - studies show CCK-4, injected into bloodstream, causes panic attacks
    - capsaicin blunts CCK-4 effects, reducing anxiety
    - digestive enzyme supplements that include amylase and trypsin might reduce overproduction
*** So CCK is not to blame for digestive caused anxiety, right?
    - not CCK but overproduction from digestive issues or leaky gut
    - most of time CCK overproduced when eat high fat meal or have issue with
      organs that help with fat digestion
    - fat malabsorption can cause diarrhea and in doing so overstimulates vagus
      nerve, exacerbating anxiety
* The true cause of heartburn / GERD
  - heartburn result of too much pressure in gastrointestinal system
  - excessive pressure causes stomach acid to push through LES and up through
    esophagus where it is stopped by UES and sent back down into stomach
  - constant increase in pressure, weakening of LES, and reflux causes symptoms
    of GERD
** Reflux can be caused by:
   - bacterial / archaeal overgrowth in intestines causes excessive hyrdogen /
     methane gas production, increasing gastrointestinal pressure
   - upper gut overgorwth in stomach upregulates protein fermentation and
     increases pressure, weakening LES
   - over ingestion of fermenting food and beverages (carbonated water, FODMAPS,
     and protein)
   - ingestion of GMO's
   - tight fitting clothing
   - incorrect posture increases pressure
   - weakend LES due to increased pressure causing more stomach contents to be
     forced up through esophagus
   - lack of digestive enzymes, resulting in poor digestion of food that can
     lead to excessive fermentation
   - yeast overgrowth causes excessive fermentation
   - constipation leading to toxin retention, leaky gut, downregulation of MMC
     function, increased fermentation, and dysbiosis
   - decrease of stomach acid productions leads to microbiome dysbiosis and poor
     protein digestion
   - poorly functional gallbladder, liver, or pancreas resulting in either
     digestive enzyme or bile production problems
   - having hiatal hernia
   - improper defecation posture
   - parasites
** GERD
   - gastroesophageal reflux disease is condition where mucosal damage is done
     to esophagus from chronic stomach acid and pepsin being trapped between
     stomach and upper esophageal sphincter. This "trapping" gives
** H Pylori
*** Ulcers
    - mostly caused by h pylori infection
    - can also be caused by NSAID's and other certain medication overuse,
      infection, chronic gastritis, and cancer
    - symptoms
      - abdominal pain
        - stomach while eating
        - duodenal three hours after meal
      - bloating or sense of fullness
      - rush of saliva during pain
      - nausea, vomiting, and melena
      - risk of perforation
        - extreme stabbing pain in abdomen and high fever
** Protocol 3 - Ditch the Standard American Diet
   - bad in excess
     - wheat
     - GMO's
     - dairy
     - carrageenan
     - artificial sweeteners
     - excessive fructose
   - following high fat/medium animal protein/low carbohydrate diets like Primal
     or Bulletproof improves digestion
   - right fat/medium plan protein (no soy)/high carboydrate diet that excludes
     wheat and whole grains and emphasizes carb intake from low fructose fruits,
     white rice, wild rice, cassava, and taro, improves digestion
   - not every diet perfect
** Protocol 4 - GMO reduction/elimination
** Protocol 5 - Clothing
   - wear loose fitting clothing and do not tighten belt overmuch
** Protocol 6 - Proper posture
   - site straight
   - excess curvature of spine increases pressure on stomach and LES
** Protocol 7 - Strengthen your LES!
   - might become damaged if SIBO, hiatal hernia, or were born with it
*** LES Protocol
** Protocol 8 - Digestive Enzymes!
*** Swedish bitters (gentian)
** Protocol 9 - Candida
   - unless you have thrush or digestive issues that point to active candida
     infection (white tongue, heartburn that is not relieved by any other
     protocols, brain fog, or allergic reactions), then average person can take
     extra virgin coconut oil and occasional probiotics to keep candida at bay
*** Herx reaction
*** Supplements to stop a yest herx reaction
*** Maintenance Candida Protocol
** Protocol 10 - Constipation
   - see chapter 9
** Protocol 11 - Maintain Proper Chloride Levels in Stomach
   - take 1/4 tsp of good quality sea salt, real salt, or pink salt in glass of
     filtered warm water on waking to help adrenal function and jump start digestion
   - if low stomach acid, drink twenty minutes before start of every meal
** Protocol 12 - Proper liver, gallbladder, and pancreas function
   - these organs deal with enzymatic and chemical part of digestion, whereas
     stomach and mouth are mixtures of enzymatic, mechanical, and chemical
   - liver produces bile and releases either into small intestine or gallbladder
   - when bile released into gallbladder, bile stored until needed
   - bile helps digest fat and further breaks down food chyme
   - pancreas produces cells that release most digestive enzymes into intestines
     - also releases sodium bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid
   - medical issues with these organs can cause GERD, diarrhea, constipation,
     gastritis, SIBO, or IBS
*** Liver
    - poor liver can be hard to identify in early stages because liver can
      regenerate easily
    - diagnosed through random metabolic panel blood tests
    - jaundice only major physical manifestation
    - also unrelenting GERD in combination with light-colored stool
*** Gallbladder
    - poor gallbladder can produce abdominal pain after eating fatty meals,
      GERD, greasy bowel movements ranging from pale to yellow, constipation,
      diarrhea, and strong odor
    - caused by lack of or too much bile
    - too little bile causes pain, constipation, GERD, and yellow, greasy, bad
      smelling stool
    - too much bile causes frequent diarrhea
    - sign of possible gallbladder attacks is referred right shoulder pain
*** Pancreas
    - similar to gallbladder indicators
    - diarrhea with high fat foods can occur
    - signs outside digestive tract include insulin resistance, elevated
      pancreatic enzyme blood levels, and diabetes
*** General Liver Health Protocol
*** Extensive Liver Detox
*** Gallbladder Protocol
*** Pancreatic Health Protocol
** Protocol 13 - Hiatal Hernia
   - symptoms
     - dull pain in chest
     - acid reflux
     - shortness of breath
     - heart palpitations
     - pain in esophagus after swallowing
*** Hiatal Hernia Protocol
** Protocol 14 - develop proper defecation posture
   - squatting best
   - squatty potty
** Protocol 15 - elimination of parasites
   - many parasites come from vegetables
*** Is piperine the golden bullet for parasite elimination?
    - may cause paralysis in parasites
*** Is diatomaceous earth the silver bullet?
    - may degrade mucous membrane in stomach if used over long period
*** Common parasites and elimination protocols
**** Blastocystic hominis
     - usually asymptomatic
     - very difficult to eliminate, may take months or years
**** Cestoda Class (tapeworms)
**** Cryptosporidium Genus
**** Cyclospora Genus
**** Dientamoeba fragilis
**** Entamoeba histolytica
** Is the magic bullet for GERD, D-Limonene?
   - daily intake of one 1000 mg capsule every other day for twenty days been
     shown to reduce or eliminate GERD symptoms in most people for six months or longer
   - coats esophagus, protects esophagus from acid and gastrin, and helps heal erosions
   - increases gastric emptying and improves bile flow
* Chapter 5
** Silent Reflux / Barrett's Esophagus LERD: Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease
   - newer, less understood cousin of GERD
   - LERD suffer more of upper airway symptoms of reflux
   - coughing, hoarseness, tachycardia after eating, esophageal spasms,
     post-nasal drip, sore throat, lump in throat feeling, hoarseness, dry
     mouth, bad taste in mouth, bad breath, loss of smell and nose function, ear
     infections, hearing problems, and asthma
   - most LERD people do not have traditional heartburn, pain in throat or
     chest, or any symptoms of GERD
   - symptoms usually arise when sitting
   - limiting acidic foods like citrus can help relieve symptoms of silent reflux
   - no proven diagnostic cause of LERD
   - best hypothesis is caused by any combination of SIBO, magnesuim deficiency,
     adrenal fatigue, hypothyroid, vagus nerve issues, zinc deficiency, improper
     collagen production in body, possible unknown infection, and / or nerve
     damage
*** General advice for LERD
    - ask physical therapist about "shaker" neck exercises that can be used to
      strengthen neck muscles (and the UES) after someone has a stroke
    - drink only room temperature water during meals and don't overeat. Eat
      three meals daily only and try not to snack at night to maintain proper
      MMC function
    - chew your food well especially if eating anything with carbohydrates
    - drink two oz of naturally alkaline water (Evamor, Icelandic Spring,
      Moutain Valley Spring Water) two hours after meal to deactivate pepsin in
      larynx. Swish well before swallowing
    - wash nasal passages out with saline at least once a day. Use saline drops
      and blow afterwards. Saline deactivates excess pepsin that might be in
      nose from reflux. Do not use neti pot because can wash away beneficial
      mucus barrier in nose
    - sleep on left side at night
    - reduce intake of acidic foods
    - if suffering from bile reflux, reduce foods high in omega 9
    - vitamin D/sun exposure very important
    - omega-3s
*** LERD Protocol
    - Zinc carnosine - one to two capsules with each meal
    - Magnesium glycinate - 200 mg per 50 lbs of body weight, taken at bedtime
**** Coat and rebuild your esophagus and larynx
     - supplement with collagen daily
     - recipe to help coat and relieve throat - in cup of hot filtered water,
       mix 1/2 teaspoon of slipper elm powder and 1/8 teaspoon of DGL powder.
       Swish well, mixing with saliva before swallowing
     - eat organic grass-fed beef liver once weekly for retinol and
       ceruloplasmin bound copper
     - consider D-limonene to coat and protect esophagus and larynx
     - liposomial colostrum to invigorate immune system
**** Tackle outstanding medical problems which may cause LERD
     - follow strengthen LES protocol
     - relieve adrenal fatigue or/and hypothyroidism
     - treat SIBO
     - treat candida

** SIBO / SIYO / Leaky Gut Syndrome
   - SIBO is opportunistic bacterial infection in small intestine
   - caused by combination of poor american diet and long-term use of
     acid-reducing medication
   - bacteria normally eliminated by stomach acid survive and flourish in small intestine
   - food proteins become partially undigested
   - allergies develop from undigested proteins as well as excessive flatulence
     and increased inflammation
   - bacteria produce protective biofilms which make eradication with
     antibiotics very difficult
   - biofilm disruption can occur by breaking down biofilm itself using system
     enzymes or by chelating iron out of biofilm to dissolve it. To chelate you
     can use calcium disodium EDTA, lactoferrin, or NAC
   - symptoms
     - indigestion
     - sharp increase or decrease in flatulence
     - constipation or diarrhea
     - reflux
     - bloating
     - abdominal pain
     - food allergies
     - low-grade fever
     - big correlation with rosacea
   - most people with IBS have SIBO
*** How to diagnose SIBO
    - hydrogen / methane breath test
      - not that reliable
      - best to tackle SIBO if you have many of symptoms with protocol and see
        how you feel
*** Are opportunistic bacteria one of the main causes of leaky gut?
    - bacteria produce gas byproducts and toxins
    - cycle can lead to nutrient deficiencies in B12 and iron
    - they decrease fat absorption in intestines that lead to stool problems
      with color / fat content and leads to deficiencies in vitamins A and D
    - intestinal lining degrades and eventually cannot digest larger food
      particles correctly
    - these larger particles start to cause food allergies and sensitivities
      (gluten first, then followed by fructose malabsorption and lactose
      digestion problems)
    - bacteria begin to enter bloodstream from loss of integrity in intestinal
      wall, which leads to an immune overreaction that causes fatigue, systemic
      joint pain, and elevated liver enzymes
    - finally they start to excrete acids that cause neurological and cognitive
      problems including brain fog and memory problems
    - vicious cycle continues as immune system tries to eliminate bacteria,
      which when reduced poison body with acids, toxins, and then different
      bacteria continue to flourish
*** The migrating motor complex and SIBO
    - digestive system eliminates waste through process known as migrating motor complex
    - cycle of peristalsis of gut occurs every two hours
    - includes four phases:
      - period of intestinal smooth muscle calmness lasting 45 to 60 minutes
      - period of roughly thirty minutes of peristaltic contractins which
        originate in stomach and propagate through small intestine
      - 5 to 15 minutes of rapid, evenly spaced peristaltic contractions. In
        contrast to digestive period, pylorus remains open during these
        contractions, allowing many indigestible material to pass into small intestine
      - short period of transition between strong contractions of third phase
        and inactivity of first phase
    - during MMC increased gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretion occurs to
      help further digestion and decrease bacterial buildup in proximal segments
      of digestive tract
    - MMC controlled by enteric hormone motilin
    - ingestion of food overrides MMC
    - therefore fasting has to occur regularly to help complete process
    - typical "growling" sounds you hear when hungry might be MMC doing its job
    - 70% of people afflicted with SIBO experience disruption of MMC rhythm
    - excessive methane/hydrogen gasses produced by overgrowth of bacteria in
      gut has been linked to decreased MMC function
    - when second and third phase of MMC reduced, bacteria remain in small
      intestine instead of being pushed into large intestine
    - bacteria then able to adhere and propagate in small intestine, which
      increases inflammation and intestinal permeability
    - reduction of stomach acid by using acid reducing medications or h pylori
      infection can contribute to poor MMC function
    - lack of exercise, grazing, and constipation can contribute to poor MMC homeostatis
    - being over-stressed and anxious can also decrease the MMC
    - low thyroid function and adrenal fatigue can lower MMC
    - fasting for at least four hours after meals during SIBO protocols may be
      beneficial in regulating MMC
    - MMC also occurs during sleep, which is why proper sleep may be more
      helpful than fasting because of the longer total fasting time that
      normally occurs during sleep
    - frequent exercise also helps regulate MMC
*** Does SIYO (small intestinal yeast overgrowth) exist?
    - candida overgrowth can manifest in small intestine and cause similar
      symptoms as if person is infected with SIBO
    - SIYO is rare, but can happen
    - same vicious cycle
    - diagnosis
      - alcohol challenge test
      - genova GI effects
*** Restore proper MMC function protocol
**** SIBO-C (constipation)
     - wait at least four hours in between meals. no snacking!
     - exercise more and walk as much as possible
     - use squatty potty when you defecate
     - supplement with tiphala - one capsule, twice daily with food
     - magnesium malate - supplement 200 mg per 50 lbs of body weight
**** SIBO-D (diarrhea)
     - include ECPO as antimicrobial agent
     - new chapter ginger force - one softgel, twice daily with meals
     - wait at least four hours in between meals. No snacking!
     - exercise more and walk as much as possible
     - use squatty potty
     - take upgraded activated charcoal, two capsules two hours after every meal
     - magnesium glycinate - supplement 200 mg per 50 lbs of body weight
**** If you have low stomach acid
     - follow betaine hcl protocol (ch 12)
     - urban moonshine digestive bitters - do not use if you have histamine
       intolerance, ulcers, or gastritis
**** If suffering from SIYO
     - thorne research molybdenum glycinate - one capsule every other day with meals
     - pure coenzyme a - follow the general supplement instructions
**** General SIBO MMC Advice
     - consider talking to your gastroenterologist about use of erythromycin (50
       mg nightly) if SIBO does not improve in few months
     - ginger, fasting between meals, exercising, using a squatty potty,
       magnesium, increasing stomach acid, and the use of the medications have
       been shown to help properly regulate the MMC
     - aldehydes have been shown to interfere with the MMC and molybdenum can
       help your body detoxify them
     - SIYO reduces coenzyme A production which interferes with the MMC
     - ECPO helps to calm MMC and can help reduce diarrhea by reducing
       intestinal spasms
*** Mild SIBO-C Protocol
**** For two to four weeks:
***** Choose one strong antimicrobial agent
      - colloidal silver (mesosilver, sovereign silver) - follow supplement
        bottle recommendations
      - thorne research berberine - take 500 mg, two capsules daily. Use with
        caution if you have ulcers, gastritis, or hypoglycemia
      - allicin-C - follow supplement bottle recommendations
      - neem - take two capsules two times daily with meals
      - atrantil - follow supplement bottle recommendations
***** Anti-biofilm protocol
      - preferred: symbiotics lactoferrin - follow supplement bottle
        recommendations (can increase up to two grams daily if needed)
      - or choose one of the following from anti-biofilm agents
        - calcium disodium EDTA: MRM Cardio Chelate - follow general supplement recommendations
        - fulvic acid: food grade fulvic acid - follow general supplement recommendations
        - guaifenesin: guai-aid - take one capsule every four to eight hours. Do
          not exceed four capsules daily. Gauifenesin is a systemic biofilm
          chelator; I do not recommend it as a first-line anti-biofilm agent in
          a protocol
        - NAC: Jarrow Formulas NAC Sustain - one table twice daily. NAC is a
          systemic biofilm chelator; I do not recommend it as a first-line
          anti-biofilm agent in a protocol. Do not supplement more than 1,200 mg
          daily, doses above this recommendation may make the NAC you take
          become a pro-oxidant
        - Systemic enzymes: interphase plus, PRX enzyme formula, Neprinol AMD -
          follow general supplement recommendations
***** Other protocol advice:

        a low-FODMAP diet
      - galactomune - one scoop daily mixed well with filtered water at
        breakfast. Use with caution if you have yeast overgrowth or Th2 elevated issues.
      - calcium disodium EDTA chelates iron out of biofilm to break it up
      - NAC or lactoferrin will do same thing
      - coconut oil used to reduce yeast overgrowth in colon and inhibit archea overgrowth
*** Mild SIBO-D Protocol

        breakfast. Use with caution if you have yeast overgrowth or Th2 elevated issues
*** Cycling of antibacterial agents and anti-biofilm agents
    - if SIBO symptoms do not get better after one month of following protocols,
      need to switch antibacterial / anti-biofilm agents with ones haven't used yet
    - also might need to obtain prescriptions for antibiotics
