* Mechanisms of the human digestive system
  - ideal digestive system eliminates toxins, governs the immune system, absorbs
    nutrients, provides peak mental health
** The mouth and esophagus
   - chewing is critical for good digestion
   - esophagus and les (lower esophageal sphincter)
** Stomach
   - only digestive organ that mechanically, chemically, and enzymatically
     digests food
*** Mechanically
    - muscles that churn food contents and mix with acid and pepsin
    - lower stomach sphincter propels food into duodenum or pushes back into
      stomach for more digesting
*** Chemically
    - hydrochloric acid
      - acid does not digest food, just maintains proper pH balance, allowing
        gastrin to be able to break down food
      - also eliminates any excess bactera that were ingested
      - can help denature proteins but pepsin does majority
    - stomach produces mucus which coats and protects the stomach wall so will
      not be harmed by gastric acid
*** Enzymatically/Hormonal
    - once stomach distends, gastrin released
      - can also be released by stimulation of vagus nerve, undigested proteins
        in stomach, and elevated levels of calcium in blood
      - stimulates stomach cells to release HCL, activates stomach cell growth,
        initiates the secretion of pepsinogen, which becomes protein enzyme
        pepsin, induces pancreatic secretions, gallbladder emptying, and causes
        LES to tighten and begin digestion
      - excess of stomach acid inhibits gastrin production
    - pepsin is primary enzyme used by stomach to digest protein
      - breaks protein into amino acids body can absorb and then becomes
        inactivated, by turning back into pepsinogen when it is mixed with
        bicarbonate released from pancreas in small intestine. This protects
        rest of intestinal system from pepsin and stomach acid
    - lipase breaks down fats
    - mucin coats lining of stomach
** On gastrin
   - hormone that controls digestion
   - gastrin release occurs because:
     - stomach body expands from consumption
     - vagus nerve stimulation
     - partially digested protein or amino acid supplements in stomach
     - hypercalcemia
     - ingestion of coffee and alcohol
     - h pylori colonization of the antrum
     - using medications including andrenergic stimulating drugs, cholinergic
       agents, and H2 antagonists / PPI's
     - hormone bombesin, ephinephrine, and gastrin releasing peptide
     - gastrin producing tumors
     - zollinger-ellison syndrome
   - signals stomach to secrete gastric acid and release histamine
   - does a lot to improve digestion
     - causes chief cells in stomach to produce pepsinogen, which becomes pepsin
     - decreases upper stomach contractoins and motility to help improve
       digestion by increasing stomach relaxation to allow ingestion of more
       food and further digestion by stomach acid and pepsin
     - opens pyloric sphincter and increases rate of gastric emptying
     - increases small intestine MMC function and helps relax ileocecal valve
     - induces pancreatic enzyme secretion
     - stimulates bile release from gallbladder
     - helps regulate production of gastric epithelial cells, tissue repair, and
       blood vessel growth in stomach
   - gastrin production limited when stomach pH is below three, fasting,
     pancreas releases somatostatin, inhibitory peptide, secretin, glucagon, and calcitonin
   - when most food out of stomach, enterogastric reflex occurs to reduce
     gastric motility, gastrin release, and gastric acid production
   - to produce appropriate gastrin levels, need to balance calcium levels,
     reduce upper gut overgrowth like h pylori, and maintain proper stomach ph
   - can achieve proper stomach ph by ingesting betaine HCL, acidic foods, or
     digestive bitters towards end of meal if you can tolerate them to help
     accurately control gastrin production and aid digestion
** Intrinsic factor
   - intrinsic factor helps absorb vitamin B12 further along in intestines
   - production of intrinsic factor in stomach can be hindered by having low
     stomach acid or by taking medications that lower stomach acid
   - supplementation of B12 might be needed
** Liver, gallbladder, and pancreas
   - further regulate the enzymatic and chemical side of digestion
   - liver produces bile and releases to small intestine or gallbladder where it
     is stored till needed
   - bile breaks down fats so digestive enzymes can fully break down food
   - pancreas produces acinar cells, responsible for releasing most of digestive
     enzymes into intestines
     - also makes ductal cells which release sodium bicarbonate into small
       intestine to neutralize stomach acid released from stomach into duodenum
** Small intestine
   - three parts, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum
   - mostly enzymatic digestion
   - cilia and muscle contractions move chyme through intestines (peristalsis)
*** Major nutrients that are digested in the small intestine
    - proteins break into peptides an amino acids
    - pepsin begins process in stomach, small intestine breaks down further
    - lipids degrade into fatty acids and glycerol. Pancreatic lipase breaks
      down triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides (accomplishes
      with help of bile acid salts which emulsify triglycerides until lipase can
      break down further to enter villi for absorption
    - pancreatic amylase breaks down carbohydrates into oligosaccharides
    - some simple carbohydrates can be converted quickly into glucose and be absorbed
    - other carbohydrates pass undigested into large intestine where they
      ferment before being broken down by bacteria
    - cellulose cannot be broken down by humans and passes through intestines
*** Nutrients that are absorbed in small intestine
    - iron in duodenum
    - water, fat, and fructose
    - vitamin B12 and bile salts in ileum
    - sodium bicarbonate
